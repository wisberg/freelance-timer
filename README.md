# Freelance Timer

Freelance Timer is a Chrome extension that tracks how long you spend working on client websites and lets you export polished PDF time reports.

## Features

- Track focused browser time for any URL prefix you configure.
- Quickly add sites from your Chrome history or manually input a pattern (e.g. `https://domain.com/wp-admin`).
- Summaries of total time and per-site breakdowns for any date range.
- Generate branded PDF reports that include favicons, durations, and detailed session information.

## Getting started

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Google Chrome.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the upper-right corner).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension` folder from this repository.
4. Pin the "Freelance Timer" action to your toolbar for easy access.

## Usage

1. Open the extension popup and add one or more URL prefixes to track.
2. Work as usualâ€”time will be captured whenever an active tab matches your tracked URLs.
3. Return to the popup to review tracked time for a date range or click **Download PDF Report** to create a shareable summary.

> **Tip:** Use the **Suggestions from History** section to quickly fill in client URLs based on your recent browsing.

## PDF exports

The extension renders a visual report, converts it into a PDF, and automatically downloads it. Each report includes:

- The Freelance Timer branding (icon) and selected date range.
- A summary by tracked URL with total hours and session counts.
- Detailed line items showing session times, durations, and URLs with the client's favicon when available.

## Data storage

All tracking data is stored locally in Chrome's extension storage. You can clear the tracked sessions by removing the extension or via Chrome's extension data controls.
